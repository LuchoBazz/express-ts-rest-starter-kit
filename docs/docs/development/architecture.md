# Project Structure Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the project's structure, designed to assist developers and technical personnel in understanding the organization and components of the application. The project is organized in a modular fashion, promoting separation of concerns and maintainability. Below is a detailed description of each folder and its purpose.

## Explanation of the Structure

### /app

This folder contains the application startup and Express routes.

### /core

The core layer, or "nucleus," contains:

- **Entities (/entities)**: Entities that represent business objects.
- **Services (/services)**: This is where the business logic resides.
- **Repositories (/repositories)**: Interfaces that define how to interact with data persistence.

### /adapters

This section includes adapters that connect the domain with the outside world:

- **API (/api)**: Express controllers that handle HTTP requests.
- **Persistence (/persistence)**: Concrete implementations of repositories (e.g., Prisma, Sequelize).
- **Mappers (/mappers)**: Optional mappers for converting data between different layers.

### /infrastructure

Contains infrastructure configurations, such as the database, logging, and any application infrastructure-related settings.

### /tests

Holds unit and integration tests, which can be divided into folders such as unit (testing domain logic) and integration (testing API, databases, etc.).
